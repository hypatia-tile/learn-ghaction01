## Cron Jobs

<!--
  A cron job is a scheduled task that runs automatically at specified intervals on Unix-like operating systems.
  It is commonly used for system maintenance, backups, and other repetitive tasks.
  Cron jobs are defined in a file called the "crontab," which contains a list of commands along with their scheduling information.
