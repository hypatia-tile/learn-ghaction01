We can comprehend the relationship by writing them in JSON format.

```JSONC
{
  "workflow": {
    "name": "CI Workflow",
    "on": ["push", "pull_request"], // Triggers for the workflow
    "jobs": { // Defines the jobs to be run in the workflow
      "build": {
        "runs-on": "ubuntu-latest",
        "steps": [ // Steps to be executed sequentially in the job
          {
            "name": "Checkout code",
            "uses": "actions/checkout@v2"
          },
          {
            "name": "Set up Node.js",
            "uses": "actions/setup-node@v2",
            "with": {
              "node-version": "14"
            }
          },
          {
            "name": "Install dependencies",
            "run": "npm install"
          },
          {
            "name": "Run tests",
            "run": "npm test"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
